Notes of relevance to working with Anaconda

# Distributions
- Full Anaconda
- Miniconda [my preference]
- Micromamba [minimalist shell install useful for headless machine install of a minimal set of package]
	- https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html
		- Note that of course the installation url could change if you are automating it
	- For example into an AWS EC2 Deep Learning AMI
